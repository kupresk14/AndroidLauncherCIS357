# Simple Android Launcher Project
This project is a project Kyler and I chose to do because we both use Android and wanted to see what making a launcher entailed. 

We enjoyed working on this project and pair programming together on the same machine. We both feel it was really helpful to the apps development as we were able to help the other person find errors.

However, due to the nature of programming on one machine my account (TimVanDyke) only has two commits, neither of which are code. This is because we didn't want to go through the motions of signing out mid workflow to switch accounts. We didn't see in the project description that the commits would be graded. 

This document is partially to clarify that we did work on this together and that my lack of commits isn't because I did no work on the project, but because we worked off the same device and pair programmed.
