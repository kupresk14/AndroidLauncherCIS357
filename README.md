# AndroidLauncherCIS357
A simple Android launcher
Authors: Kyler Kupres, Tim VanDyke

This project was designed to show up the features of a home screen launcher as well as showing customizable features.

# Functionality:
- A phone will ask the user if it wants to set the home launcher to ours, and will then ask for storage permission.
- There is a bottom drawer which can be swiped up to show all of the apps which are installed on a phone.
- To move an app from the drawer to the home screen, the user long clicks the app, and will then tap on a grid space on the main screen.
- The plus button (+) will add a page to the home screen, (up to 10 pages)
- The minus button (-) will remove the last page added from the screen. This will not remove the very first screen ever.
- The photo icon is pressed when the user desires to change the background image of the launcher
- The gear icon is a list of settings which the user can change.
